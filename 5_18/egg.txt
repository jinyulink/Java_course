彩蛋:
1. super的使用時機: 當子類別override方法時，
子類別仍可透過super呼叫原本的method。
2. 兩個演化機制:
	1. subclasses can extend to include more of their own
	 features (i.e. attributes and methods)
	2. Subclasses also own the overridden methods from
	their super class
method overriding / specialization
3. The first task in subclass's constructor : calling its direct
superclass's constructor.
3. 當子類別的建構子沒有明確呼叫父類別的建構子時，
此時會呼叫父類別的沒有參數的建構子或隱性的建構子。
4. java.lang.object
